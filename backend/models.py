# This file is no longer used for SQLAlchemy models.
# Data structures will be primarily defined by Pydantic models in schemas.py
# and the dictionaries used with the Firestore SDK.

# You can keep this file for utility functions related to data transformation
# for Firestore if needed, or delete it if all data structure definitions
# move to schemas.py.
